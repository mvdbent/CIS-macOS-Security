title: "Display login window as name and password (Automated)"
discussion: |
  [discrete]
  ==== Description:
  The login window prompts a user for his/her credentials, verifies their authorization level and then allows or denies the user access to the system.

  [discrete]
  ==== Rationale:
  Prompting the user to enter both their username and password makes it twice as hard for unauthorized users to gain access to the system since they must discover two attributes.
